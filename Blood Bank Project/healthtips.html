                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Blueberries, strawberries and raspberries contain plant nutrients known as anthocyanidins, which are powerful antioxidants. Blueberries rival grapes in concentrations of resveratrol – the antioxidant compound found in red wine that has assumed near mythological proportions. Resveratrol is believed to help protect against heart disease and cancer. <p>
                            <h6 style="color: red;">2.Curry favour.</h6>
                            <p style="color: blue;  text-align: justify; ">Hot, spicy foods containing chillies or cayenne pepper trigger endorphins, the feel-good hormones. Endorphins have a powerful, almost narcotic, effect and make you feel good after exercising. But go easy on the lamb, pork and mutton and the high-fat, creamy dishes served in many Indian restaurants.
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">3.	Cut out herbs before ops.</h6>
                        <p style="color: blue;  text-align: justify; ">>Some herbal supplements – from the popular St John's Wort and ginkgo biloba to garlic, ginger, ginseng and feverfew – can cause increased bleeding during surgery, warn surgeons. It may be wise to stop taking all medication, including herbal supplements, at least two weeks before surgery, and inform your surgeon about your herbal use.
                       </p><h6 style="color: red;"> 4.I say tomato.</h6>
                       <p style="color: blue;  text-align: justify; ">Tomato is a superstar in the fruit and veggie pantheon. Tomatoes contain lycopene, a powerful cancer fighter. They’re also rich in vitamin C. The good news is that cooked tomatoes are also nutritious, so use them in pasta, soups and casseroles, as well as in salads.
                        The British Thoracic Society says that tomatoes and apples can reduce your risk of asthma andchronic lung diseases. Both contain the antioxidant quercetin. To enjoy the benefits, eat five apples a week or a tomato every other day.
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color: red;">5.Eat your stress away.</h6>
                        <p style="color: blue;  text-align: justify; ">Prevent low blood sugar as it stresses you out. Eat regular and small healthy meals and keep fruit and veggies handy. Herbal teas will also soothe your frazzled nerves.
                        Eating unrefined carbohydrates, nuts and bananas boosts the formation of serotonin, another feel-good drug. Small amounts of protein containing the amino acid tryptamine can give you a boost when stress tires you out.
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color: red;">6.	Load up on vitamin C</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; "> We need at least 90 mg of vitamin C per day and the best way to get this is by eating at least five servings of fresh fruit and vegetables every day. So hit the oranges and guavas!
                       </p><h6 style="color: red;">7.	Pure water.</h6>
                       <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Don’t have soft drinks or energy drinks while you're exercising. Stay properlyhydrated by drinking enough water during your workout (just don't overdo things, as drinking too much water can also be dangerous). While you might need energy drinks for long-distance running, in shorter exercise sessions in the gym, your body will burn the glucose from the soft drink first, before starting to burn body fat. Same goes for eating sweets.
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">8.	Do your weights workout first.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Experts say weight training should be done first, because it's a higher intensity exercise compared to cardio. Your body is better able to handle weight training early in the workout because you're fresh and you have the energy you need to work it.
                        Conversely, cardiovascular exercise should be the last thing you do at the gym, because it helps your body recover by increasing blood flow to the muscles, and flushing out lactic acid, which builds up in the muscles while you're weight training. It’s the lactic acid that makes your muscles feel stiff and sore.
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color: red;">9.	Burn fat during intervals.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">To improve your fitness quickly and lose weight, harness the joys of interval training. Set the treadmill or step machine on the interval programme, where your speed and workload varies from minute to minute. Build up gradually, every minute and return to the starting speed. Repeat this routine. Not only will it be less monotonous, but you can train for a shorter time and achieve greater results
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">10.	Asthma-friendly sports.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Swimming is the most asthma-friendly sport of all, but cycling, canoeing, fishing, sailing and walking are also good, according to the experts.
                      </p><h6 style="color: darkviolet ">GARLIC:-</h6>
                        <h6 style="color: red;">1.	Grow beautiful hair with garlic.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Garlic could end your hair loss problems because of its high levels of allicin, a sulfur compound similar to that found in onions, which werefound to effectively treat hair loss. Rub sliced cloves of garlic on your scalp, squeezing as you go for the most benefit. You can also infuse oil with garlic and massage it into your scalp.
                    </p><h6 style="color: red;">2.	Garlic clears acne.</h6>
                    <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">It might not be a main ingredient in your drugstore acne medication, but garlic makes a great natural remedy to banish unsightly blemishes. Its antioxidants kill bacteria, so rub a sliced clove of garlic on the pimple for an effective topical treatment.
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">3.	Garlic prevents and treats colds.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Packed with antioxidants, your immune system could benefit if you give it a constant boost of powerful garlic in daily recipes. If a cold does sneak by, try sipping garlic tea: steep chopped or minced garlic in hot water for several minutes, then strain and drink. You can add a bit of honey or ginger to improve the taste.
                      </p><h6 style="color: red;"> 4.	Soothe psoriasis with garlic.</h6>
                      <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Since garlic has proven anti-inflammatory properties, it could be useful in relieving uncomfortable psoriasis outbreaks. Try rubbing a little garlic oil on the affected area for smooth, rash-free skin.
                        <h6 style="color: red;">5.	Control your weight with garlic.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; "> Garlic could help you control your weight, according to nutritionist Cynthia Sass, who cites a study that showed mice eating a garlic-rich diet reduced their weight and fat stores. Try to cook with garlic daily for tasty and waist-friendly meals.
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">6.	Keep away mosquitoes with garlic.</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">Scientists aren't sure why, but mosquitoes don't seem to like garlic. One study in India found that people who rubbed a garlicky concoction on their arms and legs weren't bothered by the pesky buggers. Make a solution of garlic oil, petroleum jelly, and beeswax for a natural repellant or place cloves of garlic nearby.
                        </p><h6 style="color: darkviolet">GINGER:-</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">1.	Haven’t been feeling hungry? Eat fresh ginger just before lunch to stoke a dull appetite and fire up the digestive juices.
                       <br> 2.	Ginger improves the absorption and assimilation of essential nutrients in the body.
                        <br>3.	Ginger clears the ‘microcirculatory channels’ of the body, including the pesky sinuses that tend to flare up from time to time.
                        <br>4.	Feeling airsick or nauseous? Chew on ginger, preferably tossed in a little honey.

                        <h6 style="color: red;"> 1. Helps in digestion</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; ">iperine present in black pepper stimulates the taste buds to signal the stomach to produce more hydrochloric acid. This acid is essential to digest proteins and other foods in the stomach, which if left undigested cause flatulence, indigestion, diarrhoea, constipation and acidity. The excess hydrochloric acid secreted helps in preventing these conditions
                        </p><h6 style="color: red;">2.	Helps you lose weight</h6>
                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; "> Black pepper is great in aiding the proper assimilation (extraction of all the nutrients) of food. Moreover, its outer layer which contains potentphytonutrientsstimulates the breakdown of fat cells. This is the reason, why this spice ranks high among the best weight loss aids.

                        <p style="color:blue;  text-align: justify; "> 1.	Chronic Inflammation and Pain The journal Oncogene published the results of a study that evaluated several anti-inflammatory compounds. It found that aspirin (Bayer, etc.) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.) are least potent, while curcumin is among the most potent anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative agents in the world. (9) This means turmeric not only has great promise with chronic pain, but since it has less side effects, it may provide safe, lasting results!
                        
                            <br>  <br>2.	Rheumatoid Arthritis Due to its high anti-inflammatory properties, turmeric is highly effective at helping people manage rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A recent study out of Japan evaluated its relationship with interleukin (IL)-6, the inflammatory cytokine known to be involved in the RA process, and discovered that curcumin “significantly reduced” these inflammatory markers. This suggests that regular turmeric use could be a potent strategy to prevent the onset of RA from developing to begin with!
                        
                        <br><br>3.	Depression Researchers from the Government Medical College (Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India) published the results of the first study this past April to evaluate curcumin’s ability to manage depression in a controlled setting. Taking 60 volunteers diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and diving the group to determine how patients treated by curcumin compared against fluoxetine (Prozac) and a combination of the two, it discovered that that the principal curcuminoid in turmeric is not only as effective as Prozac in managing depression, it doesn’t carry with it all the dangerous side effects as anti-depressive drugs do. According to the paper, “This study provides first clinical evidence that cur cumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD."
                        
                        <br><br>4.	Diabetes Turmeric is shown to lower blood glucose levels and reverse insulin resistance.

Fascinatingly, researchers proved that it’s actually 400 times more potent than Metformin (a common diabetes drug) in activating AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Turmeric acted as an anti-diabetic and antioxidant in diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes (12), improved metabolic function and reduced the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries of type 2 diabetes patients.

It seems to work on improving mitochondrial function at a cellular level, and it improves metabolism. Even against drug-resistant strains of leukemia, curcumin caused cell death of cancer cells.
